Code for suspensions in functionalised biviscous matrices with a lubrication dynamics model.

This code has been developed  in a collaboration between

 - Marco Ellero, leader of the  CFD Modelling and Simulation group at
    BCAM (Basque Center for Applied Mathematics) in Bilbao, Spain
 - Adolfo Vazquez-Quesada, from the Department of Fundamental Physics
    at UNED, in Madrid, Spain.
 - Jose Esteban  Lopez Aguilar,  from the Departamento  de Ingenieria
    Quimica at UNAM, in Mexico DF, Mexico.

 Developers: Adolfo Vazquez-Quesada.

 Code  for  simulating  suspensions  of  spherical  particles  in  a
 functionalized biviscous  fluid. The  hydrodynamic interactions  are
 modeled through lubrication  forces, so the code is  expected to be
 valid only for concentrated systems.
